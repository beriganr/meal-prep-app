# Meal Prep App

The Meal Prep App is designed to recommend dishes to users based on the ingredients they have. Users can input their available ingredients, and the app will suggest up to 10 recipes that can be made using those ingredients. 

## Features
- Search for recipes based on available ingredients
- View up to 10 recipe suggestions per search

## Future Features
